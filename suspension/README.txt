Simple example of a three dimensional suspension of particles in a
periodic domain.  These particles repel each other with a
Lennard-Jones potential.

After compiling (make main3d in the parent folder), cd into this
folder and run with:
  ../main3d input2d.suspension

This will create trajectory data in a subfolder data_IB3d.

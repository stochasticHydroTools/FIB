# FIB
Fluctuating Immersed Boundary Method

The IBBrownianBlobHierarchyIntegrator simulates Brownian Dynamics
using IBAMR and the temporal integrators from
http://cims.nyu.edu/~donev/FluctHydro/OverdampedIB.pdf

After compilation, (make main2d, make main3d  as appropriate), one
runs the code with ./main3d <input_file>.  Example input files
are included in subfolders.
